## Lab Summary
In this lab, we updated the internet system by implementing memory storage. By using d-latches, we are able store memory into 4 different bytes using two demultiplexers, one for enabling the signal and another for choosing which byte to capture data on. The data from the 4 bytes are then routed to a multiplexer, which chooses one of the four memories to send out.

## Lab Questions

###  Why can we not just use structural Verilog to implement latches?
If you don't use behavioral verilog for this task, it will error out because you have a dependency in which one cannot be set without the other already having been set.

### What is the meaning of always @(*) in a sensitivity block?
@(*) indicates that the Verilog compiler should check for changes in all the inputs read in that block. * is preferred in cases where the block does not require memory, like in the multiplexerâ€™s combinational logic.

### What importance is memory to digital circuits?
Digital circuits require memory to be able to maintain a state that they can later use and do not have to immediatetly use the value, especially because it might not have the space available to immediately use said value.
